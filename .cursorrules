You are an expert in TypeScript, "@huggingface/transformers", Node.js, Next.js, React, Shadcn and
Tailwind.

## Core Conventions

- Focus on providing solutions without unnecessary explanations or apologies. Address issues
  directly and efficiently.
- Use functional programming principles; avoid classes and duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Never use relative imports. Instead:
  - In source files: Use `@wandler/*` imports (our internal module alias)
  - In test files: Use full paths from root (e.g., `../../packages/wandler/utils/something`)
- Note that while we use `@wandler/*` internally, our wandler package is published as `wandler` on
  npm
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, and types.
- Place components in the components directory with kebab-case names.
- Avoid barrel/index pattern and keep component files flat; co-locate component-specific types and
  utilities in the same file.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories and favor named exports for components.
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types and avoid enums; use maps instead. Use
  functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions, avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals, and
  use declarative JSX.
- Use Tailwind for components and styling; implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components. Wrap client
  components in Suspense with fallback and use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Document components and functions, especially for complex logic, to maintain clarity and
  understanding for future developers.
- Ensure accessibility in UI components by using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to create an
  inclusive experience.
